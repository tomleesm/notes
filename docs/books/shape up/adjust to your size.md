# Adjust to Your Size 調整至你的規模

## Basic truths vs. specific practices 基本事實與具體實踐

To apply Shape Up to your company, it helps to separate out the basic truths from the specific practices.

為了將 Shape Up 應用於你的公司，將基本事實與具體實踐區分開來會有所幫助。

Work has to come from somewhere, and it takes work to figure out what the right work is. This is shaping. Shaping the work sets clearer boundaries and expectations for whoever does the work—whether that’s a separate team or just your future self. If we don’t make trade-offs up front by shaping, the universe will force us to make trade-offs later in a mad rush when we’re confronted by deadlines, technical limitations, or resource constraints.

工作必須來自某個地方，而找出正確的工作內容本身就需要工作。這就是塑形。塑形工作為執行工作的人設定了更清晰的界限和期望——無論是獨立的團隊還是未來的自己。如果我們不在前期透過塑形進行取捨，宇宙將迫使我們在面臨截止日期、技術限制或資源限制時，在匆忙中做出取捨。

The same is true with betting. Six weeks might not be the exact time frame for your team. But the consequences of making unclear or open-ended commitments are the same for everyone. Regardless of the specific time frame we bet on, we should be deliberate about what we bet on and cap our downside with a circuit breaker.

投注也是如此。六週可能不是你的團隊的確切時間框架。但做出不明確或開放式承諾的後果，對所有人都是一樣的。無論我們投注的具體時間框架為何，我們都應該謹慎考慮我們的投注內容，並用斷路器限制我們的下行風險。

In the building phase, there will be unknowns to deal with whether you track them on a hill chart or not. We need to distinguish the knowns from the unknowns so we can sequence the work in the right order and reserve capacity for the unknowns.

在建構階段，無論你是否在山丘圖上追蹤，都會有未知數需要處理。我們需要區分已知數和未知數，以便我們能夠以正確的順序安排工作，並為未知數保留容量。

These truths apply regardless of the size of your organization. The specific practices, on the other hand, are scale-dependent. Let’s have a look at what it means to implement Shape Up at a very small start-up and an organization that’s grown big enough for specialized roles and more structure.

這些事實適用於任何規模的組織。另一方面，具體的實踐則取決於規模。讓我們看看在非常小的初創公司以及已成長到足以擁有專業角色和更多結構的組織中，實施塑形意味著什麼。

## Small enough to wing it 小到可以隨機應變

When your team is just two or three people, everybody does a bit of everything. Since a few people are wearing many hats and performing many roles, it’s difficult to commit long chunks of uninterrupted time to specific projects. The person doing the programming might also be answering customer requests and dealing with an infrastructure issue all at the same time.

當你的團隊只有兩三個人時，每個人都會做一點所有事情。由於少數人身兼數職，很難將大段不間斷的時間投入到特定專案中。負責程式設計的人可能同時還在回覆客戶請求並處理基礎設施問題。

It’s also easier to communicate and change course when you’re small. You can drop something in the group chat or talk about it in person and everyone’s immediately on the same page.

當規模較小時，溝通和改變方向也更容易。你可以在群組聊天中丟出訊息，或當面討論，每個人都能立即理解。

For these reasons, a tiny team can throw out most of the structure. You don’t need to work six weeks at a time. You don’t need a cool-down period, formal pitches or a betting table. Instead of parallel tracks with dedicated shapers and builders, the same people can alternate back and forth. Be deliberate about which hat you’re wearing and what phase you’re in. Set an appetite, shape what to do next, build it, then shape the next thing. Your bets might be different sizes each time: maybe two weeks here, three weeks there. You’re still shaping, betting, and building, but you’re doing it more fluidly without the rigid structure of cycles and cool-downs.

基於這些原因，小型團隊可以捨棄大部分的結構。你不必一次工作六週。你不需要冷卻期、正式提案或投注桌。相反，同樣的人可以在專用的塑形者和建構者之間來回切換，而不是平行軌道。明確你正在扮演的角色以及你所處的階段。設定胃口，塑形下一步要做什麼，建構它，然後塑形下一件事。你的投注每次可能會有不同的規模：這裡可能是兩週，那裡可能是三週。你仍然在塑形、投注和建構，但你做得更流暢，沒有週期和冷卻期的僵化結構。

[![A diagram depicting how the work transforms through four phases. First the work is like a cloud with a question mark in it. It's labled: Raw idea or request. Then the work acquires a defined outline with an empty interior. It is labeled: Shaped pitch. A vertical dotted line separates the next phase, and an arrow curling over the dotted line is labeled: Betting. Then the defined outline gets some dotted line boundaries inside to indicate scopes. One of them is checked off. Finally the interior is fully divided by scopes with many of them complete.](./images/phases_of_work.png)](./images/phases_of_work.png)

The phases of the work still hold true even if you don’t work in cycles or have dedicated people to do the shaping and building

即使你不以週期方式工作，或沒有專門人員進行塑形和建構，工作階段的本質仍然成立。

## Big enough to specialize 大到可以專業分工

After you hire more people, all of this fluidity flips from an asset to a liability. Winging it with ad-hoc meetings and chat room discussions doesn’t work anymore. Coordination starts to eat up more of your time and things begin to slip through the cracks.

當你僱用更多人後，所有這些流動性都會從資產轉變為負債。隨機應變的臨時會議和聊天室討論不再有效。協調開始佔用你更多的時間，事情也開始出現疏漏。

This is when it makes sense to take on the structure of six-week cycles, cool-downs, and a formal betting table. With more people available to build, someone needs to carve out more time to do the work of figuring out _what_ to build. This could mean a founder spends more time shaping than building, or it could mean elevating an employee from doing in-cycle design work to more out-of-cycle shaping work.

這時採用六週週期、冷卻期和正式投注桌的結構才有意義。隨著更多人可以參與建構，需要有人騰出更多時間來研究_建構什麼_。這可能意味著創始人花費更多時間進行塑形而不是建構，或者可能意味著將員工從週期內的設計工作提升到週期外的塑形工作。

At Basecamp’s current size (about 50 people in the whole company, roughly a dozen in the product team) we’ve been able to specialize roles so teams of designers and programmers can work without any interruption in the cycles. A dedicated team called SIP (Security, Infrastructure, and Performance) handles technical work that’s lower in the stack and more structural. Our Ops team keeps the lights on. We have technical people on the Support team who can investigate problems raised by customers. All this means that we don’t need to interrupt the designers and programmers on our Core Product team who work on shaped projects within the cycles.

以 Basecamp 目前的規模（全公司約50人，產品團隊約十幾人），我們已經能夠將角色專業化，讓設計師和程式設計師團隊可以在週期內不受任何干擾地工作。一個名為SIP（安全、基礎設施和效能）的專門團隊負責處理堆疊較低且更具結構性的技術工作。我們的營運團隊維持系統運作。我們在支援團隊中有技術人員，可以調查客戶提出的問題。這一切都意味著，我們不需要打斷核心產品團隊中在週期內處理塑形專案的設計師和程式設計師。

With dedicated shapers and builders, the picture is more structured. Shapers work on an “out of cycle” track. Cool-down between cycles gives everyone room to fix bugs and address loose ends that pop up. The betting table is held during cool-down and then bets are placed for the next cycle.

有了專職的塑形者和建構者，情況會更有條理。塑形者在「週期外」的軌道上工作。週期之間的冷卻期讓所有人都有空間修復錯誤並處理突發的零碎事務。投注桌在冷卻期舉行，然後為下一個週期進行投注。

[![Diagram depicting the two tracks and what happens at the same time. A horizontal dotted line marks the boundary between the two tracks. The upper track is labeled: Out of cycle and the lower track is labled: In cycle. The tracks are sliced vertically by blocks of time: a six week block followed by a two week block, then another six week block and so on. Arrows point from a box marked Shape in the six week block on the out-of-cycle track over to a Bet box in the two-week block. An arrow from the Bet box descends down to the lower track and points to a Build box in the following six week block. Between build blocks, the two-week gap is labeled: Cool down.](./images/two_tracks.png)](./images/two_tracks.png)

With more people, shaping and building happen on separate tracks and bets are made to fill six-week cycles

隨著人員增加，塑形和建構在不同的軌道上進行，並透過投注來填滿六週的週期。
